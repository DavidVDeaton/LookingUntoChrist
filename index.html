                  <!-- <p class="font20">For all who earnestly seek to accept the Lord Jesus Christ’s loving invitation to come unto Him and partake of the fruit of the tree of life, there is tremendous need for us to understand how literally and directly the adversary is endeavoring to defeat our discipleship by tampering with our thoughts. Cunningly disguised as our own mental processes, Satan’s meddlings go way beyond what most people recognize as temptations. Thoughts that tear down our sense of worth and worthiness, undermine our hope and confidence, foster grudges and negative feelings towards others, and fill us with fear, doubt and discouragement are also of satanic origin.</p>
                  <p class="font20">The biggest lies you will ever hear are in your head, masquerading as your own thoughts. Unfortunately, most people do not recognize these intrusions for what they actually are nor where they’re coming from. As a result, many of us berate ourselves for the negative states of mind that derail our devotion and weaken our faith, and therefore needlessly struggle to dispel them.</p>
                  <p class="font20">Pointedly, we can’t win the war if we’re fighting the wrong foe.</p> -->

                    <p class="excerpt-p">Though we can scarcely wrap our mortal minds around the vast concept of eternity or something always existing—having no beginning and no end—Joseph wants us to do our best to grasp that concept. He wants us to not only understand that God is an eternal, self-existent being, he wants us to understand that the same truth applies to us. Of all the stunning eternal truths taught by the Prophet Joseph Smith, none outranks his teachings about who we are and how we relate to our Father in Heaven. When it comes to conscious beings, the first startling truth is: In the beginning there was no beginning. All the conscious beings we refer to—in whatever state of progression they may be—Gods, angels, unembodied spirits, disembodied spirits, mortal men, women    and children—as conscious thinking individuals, none had a beginning.</p>

              <p class="font20e">"This book is not a pep talk. It’s a colorful, guided journey to the very core of who we are and what makes us function better as children of God. While reading, I found myself making easy and deep decisions about how I should think… and how I can rely on Jesus in a practical way to help me progress. Dr. Deaton’s storytelling is masterful and makes application of what he’s teaching seem doable. This book delivers hope through narrative, doctrine, and a lifetime of the author’s quest to understand what makes people improve."</p>

"Looking Unto Christ in Every Thought" brings new meaning to how and why we must, Hear Christ, for ourselves. Being involved in the Addiction Recovery Program for the last 18 years both as a participant and as an Elder clled to the program, I can testify how valuable this book will be for all who suffer with addiction of any kind. This is a book that needs to be read more than once or twice, it needs to be pondered and likened to our own lives."</p>

              <p class="font20e">"This book spoke to my heart—so inspiring and true. Noting the influence Satan has in our world, it explains how we can rebuke him and seek to follow the Savior.

              <p class="font20e">"Dennis’ ability to talk about and warn against the wiles and ways of the adversary, while maintaining focus on Jesus Christ and His doctrines, is accomplished in expert fashion. His many years of secular and spiritual study come together beautifully to explain in layman’s terms how to recognize the solicitations of the evil one and triumph over him through Christ. This book is a notable and worthwhile piece of literature from which much can be gained by those who will read and implement its principles."</p>

            <div id="endor7">
              <p class="font20e">"Looking Unto Christ does a fabulous job teaching that thoughts are governed by principles. Dr. Deaton does a wonderful job breaking these eternal principles down into skills that the reader can use to bring power over their thoughts. It will also help you understand ways to eliminate self-doubt and fear that holds us back from reaching our true potential. You will learn that not only do you have more power than you can imagine but you can use that imagination to create so much good for many people."</p>
