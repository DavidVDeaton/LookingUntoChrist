              <h5 class="mont">Superintendent Blue Ridge Unified School District</h5>
              <p class="mont">I more than enjoyed reading this book, I have greatly benefited from it— especially the teachings about fear and worry. I hope this invaluable message gets into the hands of the many thousands who need it.<span class="delete"> There’s nothing like it currently available. It’s truly </span>one of the best books I’ve ever read!</p>

              <h5 class="mont">Author, "Reflections of Christ"</h5>
              <p class="mont">This book is not a pep talk. It’s a colorful, guided journey to the very core of who we are and what makes us function better as children of God. While reading, I found myself making easy and deep decisions about how I should think… and how I can rely on Jesus in a practical way to help me progress. Dr. Deaton’s storytelling is masterful and makes application of what he’s teaching seem doable. This book delivers hope through narrative, doctrine, and a lifetime of the author’s quest to understand what makes people improve.</p>

              <h5 class="mont">Owner, Jillily Studio</h5>
              <p class="mont">This book spoke to my heart—so inspiring and true. Noting the influence Satan has in our world, it explains how we can rebuke him and seek to follow the Savior. I highly recommend this book to all who are seeking to leave negativity behind and take control of their thoughts and actions.</p>

              <h4 class="mont">Robert R. Earl</h4>
              <h5 class="mont">DDS, Dental Practice Management Consultant</h5>
              <p class="mont">Brother Deaton's new book will be life changing for everyone who reads it. "Looking Unto Christ in Every Thought" brings new meaning to how and why we must, Hear Christ, for ourselves. Being involved in the Addiction Recovery Program for the last 18 years both as a participant and as an Elder called to the program, I can testify how valuable this book will be for all who suffer with addiction of any kind. This is a book that needs to be read more than once or twice, it needs to be pondered and likened to our own lives.</p>

              <h4 class="mont">R. Dean Arnson</h4>
              <h5 class="mont">Queen Creek Arizona Heritage Stake President</h5>
              <p class="mont">Dennis’ ability to talk about and warn against the wiles and ways of the adversary, while maintaining focus on Jesus Christ and His doctrines, is accomplished in expert fashion. His many years of secular and spiritual study come together beautifully to explain in layman’s terms how to recognize the solicitations of the evil one and triumph over him through Christ. This book is a notable and worthwhile piece of literature from which much can be gained by those who will read and implement its principles.</p>

              <h5 class="mont">Lean Management Business Consultant</h5>
              <p class="mont">This is a remarkable work and vital for our times. Dennis has captured the scriptural essentials and pragmatic solutions to help us overcome the influence of the adversary in our lives.  Beautifully written and authenticated, this book will be cherished by all readers.</p>
