Cunningly disguised as our own mental processes, Satan’s meddlings go way beyond what most people recognize as temptations. Thoughts that tear down our sense of worth and worthiness, undermine our hope and confidence, foster grudges and negative feelings towards others, and fill us with fear, doubt and discouragement are also of satanic origin.</p>
                <p class="mont">The biggest lies you will ever hear are in your head, masquerading as your own thoughts. Unfortunately, most people do not recognize these meddlings for what they actually are nor where they’re coming from. As a result then, too many of us berate ourselves for the negative states of mind that derail our devotion and weaken our faith, and therefore needlessly struggle to dispel them. Pointedly, we can’t win the war if we’re fighting the wrong foe.</p>
