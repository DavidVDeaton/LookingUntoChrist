He wants us to not only understand that God is an eternal, self-existent being, he wants us to understand that the same truth applies to us. Of all the stunning eternal truths taught by the Prophet Joseph Smith, none outranks his teachings about who we are and how we relate to our Father in Heaven. When it comes to conscious beings, the first startling truth is: In the beginning there was no beginning. All the conscious beings we refer to—in whatever state of progression they may be—Gods, angels, unembodied spirits, disembodied spirits, mortal men, women and children—as conscious thinking individuals, none had a beginning.</p><h6>Page 14</h6>");

Ultimately, the highest and wisest use of my agency is to come unto Christ, look to Him in every thought, and willfully submit with all my mental, emotional, physical and spiritual faculties to follow the covenant path of unqualified, unconditional discipleship. No one else can do it for me. There is no salvation by proxy for the living.</p><p>Each one of us has to make up our minds to have no other gods before Him and to come unto Christ with all our might, mind and strength (2 Nephi 25:29). No lazy, half-hearted, feeble-minded effort will do. We’re the only ones who can decide to take control of our mortal, easily tempted, frequently distracted mind and worship the only true God and Jesus Christ whom Heavenly Father has sent. Thus on that basis I submit to you this declaration:</p><p>The consummate truth of life is that we alter our destiny by altering our thoughts.</p><p>The mind is our most crucial determinant, our crowning asset, our ultimate arena of battle.</p><p>If we will master the power of our minds, we may do or be whatsoever we will.</p><p>It all begins and it all depends on your mind.</p><h6>Page 52</h6>");

Initially, it is a temptation and only a temptation. In mortality, we cannot stop the perpetual influx of enticements and temptations. It is the crux of our mortal test. Temptations become sins only if we accept and dwell on them. If you entertain them, add to them, or even “savor” them, then, yes, you are committing sin in your head, as the Lord plainly taught (Matt 5:28; 3 Ne. 12:28). However, if you catch and identify them for what they are—Satan’s tawdry attempts to get you to sin—and promptly shift your thinking, refusing to dwell on them, you have not sinned. If fact, the opposite is true; you have actually increased in righteousness. Lehi taught that the very definition of righteousness is to be exposed to temptation but not succumb to it (2 Ne 2:13). Each time you unmask one of Satan’s ploys and reject it, you achieve a small but significant moral victory and add another drop of oil to your lamp of righteousness.</p><p>Without this insight, we also become vulnerable to another satanic ploy, which Satan throws on top of the first temptation. Once he’s convinced you and me that we’re the one who spawned the temptation, he berates us and then compounds his assault by suggesting we may as well continue since we’ve already sinned in our minds.</p><h6>Page 94</h6>");

Any thought that tears you down; diminishes your sense of worth; questions your identity as a child of God; or urges you to doubt, belittle, or berate yourself, is not coming from you (your intelligence of spirit); and it is most certainly not coming from a divine source. It is coming from the depths of the infernal pit, from Lucifer and the household of Satan on the dark side of the veil.</p><h6>Page 100</h6>");

Sometimes it seems as though there’s no time for a choice anywhere along the sequence. Something happens and, bam, we go from interpretation to emotion to reaction in less than a blink of the eye—in a seemingly unavoidable case of a stimulus generating an automatic set response. In those moments, SKAM immediately shifts our attention from what we can do to intercept the reaction by telling us we had no choice because it wasn’t our fault. Our reaction, he suggests, was caused by some outside source—generally another person. He wants to divert our attention from our role in the matter, by urging us to dive headlong into finger-pointing and wishing everybody else would grow up and change. He must laugh at our frustration every time we think we can actually blame somebody else into improving our behavior—or their behavior sufficient to improve our outcomes.</p><h6>Page 145</h6>");

Clearly, Lucifer has succeeded in creating confusion and spreading enmity upon the earth about many moral issues—the definition of life, gender, marriage, and religious freedom. Beyond such larger issues, we are even inundated in contradictory information about simple everyday matters. When someone encourages us “to eat healthy” does anyone know with certainty what in today’s world that means? Are eggs good for you or not? What about oils and fats? Does wheat heal or harm? Which kinds of vitamin supplements cause cancer rather than cure it? Names for dietary plans have become identities. Are you Vegan? Paleo? Or, Mitochondrial?

The apex of human arrogance is reached when we mortals deign to prescribe what kind of being God should be and how He should conduct His relationship with His children. We don’t think of it in terms of actually creating God’s job description for Him, but that’s exactly what we do. It is also very difficult not to align our personal conception of God with the prevailing “wisdom” of the day in which we live, blending it with our own interpretation of what life should be like and the way we want things to be. In effect, we believe there is a God, but forget that we’re not Him.</p><p>The Apostle Paul found it very difficult to convince the Jews in his day that God had the right to institute a higher law. . . They even cried out for the Savior to be crucified because the Messiah they saw before them—beaten, scourged and bleeding—humbly submitting His will to that of the Father—did not fit their mental image of what the Messiah was supposed to look like and do. The Messiah they had conjured was supposed to incinerate the wicked, oppressing Romans, return Israel to its former glory and world supremacy, and feed them bread on a daily basis.

May we look unto Christ in every thought and never forget the ultimate climb the Savior had to make in order for our climbs to have any meaning. A clear sign we are exercising our faith is when we can be grateful for the hard stuff. Again, it helps to remember the pattern. The most significant part of life-transforming events, that part we all need to be the most grateful for, is not the easy start. Nor is it the grand and glorious finish. It’s the hard stuff in the middle in between the easy starts and the glorious finishes that makes the whole thing great. For that reason, we can even be grateful for doubts and discouragement. Without them acting upon his mind, Matt’s victory would not have had the inner power it did. Without Climbs 6, 7, 8 and 9, Climb 13 would have had no glory.</p><p>Very few will escape moments where it seems like all we can do is endure.

It gets better. “And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?” At this statement, Peter and His disciples are stunned and mystified. Here is Jesus, surrounded by a mob, pushed, jostled and pressed upon from every angle as in an adoring mosh pit, and he’s asking, “who touched me?” The disciples are thinking, “What? Who touched you? They all touched you. Everybody did. Everybody’s laying their hands on you. You’re being mauled!” “And Jesus said, ‘Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me’” (Luke 8:46, emphasis added). Now we arrive at the crux of this miracle and the glorious good news it holds out for all of us. The word translated “virtue” by the King James translators is “dunamis,” from the root word “dunami,” meaning force or power, the same root of the word dynamo in English. At the moment the woman touched the border of Christ’s garment, there was an actual transfer of power from the body of the Lord to the body of the woman! He felt it! She felt it—“she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.” He that hath ears, let him hear and ponder.</p><h6>Page 338</h6>");
