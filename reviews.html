                <p class="font20">"Dennis’ ability to talk about and warn against the wiles and ways of the adversary, while maintaining focus on Jesus Christ and His doctrines, is accomplished in expert fashion. His many years of secular and spiritual study come together beautifully to explain in layman’s terms how to recognize the solicitations of the evil one and triumph over him through Christ. This book is a notable and worthwhile piece of literature from which much can be gained by those who will read and implement its principles."</p>

                <p class="font20">"Looking Unto Christ does a fabulous job teaching that thoughts are governed by principles. Dr. Deaton does a wonderful job breaking these eternal principles down into skills that the reader can use to bring power over their thoughts. It will also help you understand ways to eliminate self-doubt and fear that holds us back from reaching our true potential. You will learn that not only do you have more power than you can imagine but you can use that imagination to create so much good for many people."</p>

While reading, I found myself making easy and deep decisions about how I should think… and how I can rely on Jesus in a practical way to help me progress. Dr. Deaton’s storytelling is masterful and makes application of what he’s teaching seem doable. This book delivers hope through narrative, doctrine, and a lifetime of the author’s quest to understand what makes people improve."</p>

"Looking Unto Christ in Every Thought" brings new meaning to how and why we must, Hear Christ, for ourselves. Being involved in the Addiction Recovery Program for the last 18 years both as a participant and as an Elder clled to the program, I can testify how valuable this book will be for all who suffer with addiction of any kind.

              <p>I really cannot put into words how appropriate and timely these 3 chapters have meant to me. It’s an absolute miracle from a loving Heavenly Father that we connected this week. This is one of the most powerful miracles I’ve ever received in my life, and I really mean that. I’m so grateful!!!</p>

              <p>Over the past several years I have become keenly aware of the influence of the adversary on my thoughts. Just over a year ago I told a trusted friend the thought I would have every time someone complimented me for any reason. It was, "If they really knew me, they wouldn't say that about me!" I cannot pinpoint when this particular thought was given to me, but I adopted it and believed it for many years. Once I recognized the source of this thought, I worked on a response, a rebuttal. The response I composed is simple, but powerful. It is, "They are seeing who I truly am, my divine nature!" As I consciously responded each time with this rebuttal, it became second nature and the original thought became softer and softer until it disappeared. I cannot adequately express how empowering that experience was and how I feel about myself now. It has also helped me to connect on a deeper level with my Heavenly Parents and my Redeemer.</p>
