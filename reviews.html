                <p class="mont font18">I really cannot put into words how appropriate and timely these 3 chapters have meant to me. It’s an absolute miracle from a loving Heavenly Father that we connected this week. This is one of the most powerful miracles I’ve ever received in my life, and I really mean that. I’m so grateful!!!</p>

                <p class="mont font18">Over the past several years I have become keenly aware of the influence of the adversary on my thoughts. Just over a year ago I told a trusted friend the thought I would have every time someone complimented me for any reason. It was, "If they really knew me, they wouldn't say that about me!" I cannot pinpoint when this particular thought was given to me, but I adopted it and believed it for many years. Once I recognized the source of this thought, I worked on a response, a rebuttal. The response I composed is simple, but powerful. It is, "They are seeing who I truly am, my divine nature!" As I consciously responded each time with this rebuttal, it became second nature and the original thought became softer and softer until it disappeared. I cannot adequately express how empowering that experience was and how I feel about myself now. It has also helped me to connect on a deeper level with my Heavenly Parents and my Redeemer.</p>
